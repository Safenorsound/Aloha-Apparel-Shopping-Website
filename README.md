# Aloha Project - Red Academy

<h1>Personal Learning</h1>

This was my first project with RED Academy. It functioned as an introduction to the various roles and syntaxes of different techologies. The site was designed responsively in a mobile-first format to dynamically react to different screen widths for tablets and desktops devices. In addition, this project familiarized me with Chrome's developer tools and with Github's functinoality.
